/* Channel built using a signal variable or signal:
 *
 * A signal object is wrapper on top of a promise, behaviours can be
 * triggered when a codition has been met by when'ing on the cown returned
 * by await. When the the signal vairable is signalled, the current
 * promise is fulfilled and replaced with a new promise. Any behaviours that
 * we waiting for the signal previouslt can now run.
 *
 * A channel is built on top of this by having a channel use a signal
 * variable that any unfulfilled read waits on, when wite happens (changing
 * the state of the channel) all waiting reads are signalled and all try to
 * read values. Any reads that did not succesfully read a value, wait again
 * on the signal variable.
 *
 * This example then uses a single producer and consumer to write and read
 * values into and out of the channel
