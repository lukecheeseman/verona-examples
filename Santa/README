The Santa problem was proposed in 1994, J. A. Trono. A new exercise in 
concurrency. SIGCSE Bull., 26(3):8–10, 1994.

In this problem there are:
 - 1 Santa
 - 9 Reindeer
 - 7 Elves

- When Santa and 9 Reindeer are available then they should be taken
  (making them unavailable) and deliver presents. When they are
  finished, Santa becomes available again and the Reindeers each go on
  holiday, becoming available again when they come back from holiday.
 
 - When Santa and 3 Elves are available then they should be taken
   (making them unavailable) and meet in the study. When they are
   finished, Santa becomes available again and the Elves each go to
   work, becoming available again when they finish working.  

A solution using chords was described in J. A. Trono. A new exercise in concurrency. SIGCSE Bull., 26(3):8–10, 1994.
